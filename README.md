# On-The-Map

**On The Map** lets Udacity students check-in at a location they are studying from using Apple's Core Location and MapKit Frameworks. Authenticated users are able to see other student's studying locations represented as pins on a map by using a RESTful API.

This purpost of this project was to demonstrate:
* Accessing networked data using Appleâ€™s URL loading framework
* Authenticating a user using over a network connection
* Creating user interfaces that are responsive, and communicate network activity
* Using Core Location and the MapKit framework to display annotated pins on a map
